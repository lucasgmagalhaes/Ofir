# Language completeness and ecosystem plan

Status: **proposed inventory**, surveyed at `58c340e` on 2026-11-04.
This covers a general-purpose language, including its compiler, runtime,
libraries, tools, distribution and maintenance. It is not a specification or
a commitment to ship every capability in version 1.0.

The 86 OFIR records below are capability and acceptance records, not 86 missing
implementations. Many extend or audit existing roadmap tasks. The 49 records in
the [API ecosystem plan](api-ecosystem.md) form a subordinate service plan;
overlapping capabilities must share implementation tasks and must not be counted
twice. Existing roadmap completion markers remain authoritative.

## Evidence and coverage

This is a targeted repository survey, not a new conformance or correctness run.
The first deliverable is a maintained implementation matrix: every normative
feature needs its spec/ADR, compiler stage, source, positive/negative fixtures,
target coverage, diagnostics and latest verification evidence. Use these states:
**implemented and verified**, **partial**, **designed**, **proposed**, or
**deferred/rejected**. A chapter, syntax example or parser node alone does not
prove implementation. Stage 0 remains the bootstrap subset.

| Starting point | Evidence | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Bootstrap and test infrastructure exist | [Bootstrap](../bootstrap.md), [testing](testing.md), [stage comparison](../../tools/compare_stages.py) | Extend these gates; do not plan their creation again |
| Accepted design exceeds implemented language | [Specification](../spec/README.md), [roadmap](../roadmap.md) | Track per-feature conformance and explicit unsupported cases |
| Checker still has unsupported paths | [Expression checker](../../compiler/sema/expr_check.of), [type checker](../../compiler/sema/check_types.of) | Audit function values, named arguments, ranges outside loops, mutable slices and array lengths individually |
| Language support in VS Code is a starting point | [Extension manifest](../../editors/vscode/package.json) | Grammar and icons do not supply LSP or debugger integration |
| Standard-library reference contains planned APIs | [Utilities](../std/utilities.md), [collections](../std/collections.md), [API inventory](api-ecosystem.md) | Verify exported code and tests before labeling an API available |
| Several foundational choices are already accepted | [ADRs](../adr/README.md) | Respect ownership, errors as values and bootstrap constraints |

## Priorities and interpretation

- **G0:** establish implementation truth, safety and trustworthy builds.
- **G1:** proposed general-purpose baseline; select release scope explicitly.
- **G2:** optional specialization, justified by a concrete workload and owner.
- **A:** audit or extend existing work; **D:** already designed/planned;
  **N:** newly explicit backlog coverage; **X:** decision required, possibly reject.

Dependencies name existing roadmap items or related capability records. Each row
can require several small PRs. Completion means its evidence is recorded, not
that every possible extension has been implemented.

| OFIR-43 | G1/D | Streams, filesystem, paths, processes, environment, clocks and dates | Reuse API-01–API-08; portable contracts and cleanup tests |
| OFIR-44 | G1/N | Serialization, byte order, encodings, checksums and compression | Reuse API-13–API-16; assess CSV/TOML/YAML/XML and archives independently |

| OFIR-55 | G2/X | C++, Python, JVM, .NET, JavaScript and plugin adapters | Select consumers; versioned C/component boundary and lifecycle tests |

## 6.28 — Developer experience

| ID | Priority/type | Capability and dependencies | Completion evidence |

Use the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
and [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/overview.html)
as integration references. Syntax highlighting alone satisfies neither contract.

## 6.29 — Packages, builds and distribution

| ID | Priority/type | Capability and dependencies | Completion evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| OFIR-64 | G1/D | Dependency resolution and locks (6.5) | Version conflicts, cycles, checksums and deterministic resolution tested |
| OFIR-65 | G1/N | Workspaces and dependency sources | Path/git/registry, dev/build/target dependencies, overrides, vendoring and offline contracts |
| OFIR-66 | G1/N | Build profiles, configuration and native/generated inputs | If hooks are adopted, specify host/target, declared inputs and network/permission policy |
| OFIR-67 | G1/N | Registry and publishing | Namespaces, authentication, immutable versions, yanking, mirrors and recovery |
| OFIR-68 | G1/N | Supply-chain integrity and provenance | Checksums, trust roots, advisories, license metadata and SBOM; reuse API-47 |
| OFIR-69 | G1/N | Installation and toolchain management | Clean-machine archives/install, pinned toolchains, checksums, rollback and uninstall |

| OFIR-71 | G1/N | Release engineering | Candidates, compatibility corpus, LLVM matrix, patch policy and installed-artifact tests |

Bootstrap IR parity and binary reproducibility are different gates. The latter
requires defined inputs/environment and bit-identical selected artifacts; see
the [reproducible-build definition](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/definition/).

| OFIR-82 | G1/N | Package discovery and ecosystem quality | Searchable docs/compatibility metadata, examples and criteria for maintained official packages |
| OFIR-83 | G2/X | GUI/TUI, graphics, audio and media | Package-level workload, event-loop, accessibility and platform requirements |
| OFIR-84 | G2/X | Scientific/data/ML computing | Arrays/tensors, SIMD/BLAS, dataframes and GPU only with concrete performance/memory goals |

## Architectural boundaries and non-goals

Preserve accepted ADRs: ownership without mandatory GC, errors as values, panic
abort, structural interfaces, monomorphization and compile-time reflection.
This inventory does not introduce inheritance, exceptions, unrestricted runtime
reflection, operator overloading or mandatory async. Reconsider a choice only
through a concrete proposal and ADR, with compatibility and maintenance costs.

Compiler features belong in the language only when libraries cannot express the
required semantics. Portable primitives belong in runtime/std; databases,
frameworks, GUI and vendor SDKs usually belong in versioned packages. A general
purpose language does not need to bundle every domain ecosystem.

For decisions, consult [Unicode identifier guidance](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/)
without assuming Unicode identifiers must be adopted. The
[Rust undefined-behavior reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html)
illustrates the precision needed for unsafe contracts; it does not define Ofir's
semantics. [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) is an optional host-interface reference,
not a current Ofir target guarantee.

## Recommended sequence and release gates

1. Establish OFIR-01/02/03/07 and audit ownership, allocation, ABI, compiler
   invariants, bootstrap and existing quality gates. Classify unknowns honestly.
2. Finish accepted phase 5 features in dependency order; preserve completed
   work and coordinate shared interfaces. The sequential next item remains 5.17.
3. Advance general std, threads, editor tools, packages and installation alongside
   independent API foundations. Do not make all progress depend on HTTP or async.
4. Validate real CLI, C interoperability and concurrent programs as well as the
   API reference service. Feed missing semantics and ergonomics back into tasks.
5. Select the G1 release subset explicitly. Freeze contracts only after target
   coverage, compatibility, installation and maintenance evidence exists.
   G2 tracks need their own owners and acceptance decisions.

A release review should show the implementation matrix, supported target and
LLVM versions, bootstrap evidence, conformance/security results, performance
budgets, std/package compatibility, clean installation, migration guidance and
release ownership. Compiler architecture performance targets are goals until
measured; passing stage parity is not proof of all these properties.

Before activating a record, attach its existing roadmap item where applicable,
owner, spec/ADR decision, dependencies, stage/target scope and concrete tests.
Split work into independently reviewable PRs; estimate those PRs rather than
assigning a misleading size to this inventory. Keep the roadmap, specification,
standard-library reference and risk register consistent as decisions are made.
